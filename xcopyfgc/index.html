  <h1 class="post-title">Xcopyfgc: an attempt at a general Shadow Ai system.</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2021-05-05</span>
  <p>Fighting game ai is bad. 
Atleast on average.
In fact fighting game ai often fails at it's purpose: to give players a sense of the dominant strategies of the game or character, in addition introduce players to the current meta.
Often it does the opposite, by introducing players to strategies only a computer can accomplish.
Even when a game comes out that pushes the envelope on ai the advancements made are rarely adopted by newer games.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect this isn't the developers' fault. 
There is a lot to do in game development, and software development in general,
if any portion of a fighting game would get the short end of the budget I suspect it would be ai.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Killer Instinct's Shadow Ai is the most recent well known push on ai in fighting games.
Shadow Ai attempts to mimic player behavior, by recording and playing back player inputs.
Derek Neal and Bruce Hayles thoroughly explain the system in the GDC talk below.</p>

<p>This project, xcopyfgc, is my attempt to replicate the techniques used by Shadow Ai in a general purpose ai program for fighting games.
This means a tool that can easily be used for any fighting game, in a manner that is as close to plug and play as possible.</p>
<h2 id="plan-for-creation">Plan for creation</h2>
<p>Creating something like Shadow Ai is no small task.
This task is further complicated by the lack of direct access to player/character information, or game state.
For that reason the project can be broken into two pieces. One aimed at deriving game state, the other the brain of the ai. </p>
<p>Game state, for fighting games, is information describing everything from distance between two characters, to how often a player jumps. 
When working within a code base these quantities are much more easily and quickly determined.
Many hobbyist fighting game ai developers determine game state by grabs values from game memory. 
This project will not. Instead, game state information will be determined using visuals and audio.
This choice offers significant advantages and disadvantages.
Audio and visual information allows for a general method to derive game state. 
Fighting games use a common visual and auditory language. These common design elements common allow players/spectators to quickly parse unfamiliar games. 
These elements can also be used to construct algorithms.
Deriving game state using this technique is difficult, and can often produce results inconsistent with reality.</p>
<p>I'll discuss the specifics for parsing audio and visual information later, but the basics, as stated before, are leveraged from common fighting game design language.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>heath bars at the top of screen.</li>
<li>color palettes of playable characters being distinct between opposing characters and the background.</li>
<li>consistent prematch starting positions </li>
<li>and other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the use of these elements in addition to incorporating naive machine learning one can determine some of the basics features a game state.</p>
<p>Outside of game state the brain of the ai needs to be created.
Here I leverage the work described by Iron Galaxy.
Xcopyfgc uses recorded user inputs and game state data to determine what the ai should do next.
I like to think of the system as a train on a set of train tracks. 
During a match the ai replays the inputs recorded by the player all the while checking the game state. 
This is the train moving along on the track.
If the current game state becomes too dissimilar to the recorded game state the ai will look to a different recording that better matches the current state.
If it finds one it switches the track.
I'll be writing an in depth post on this some time later as well, but this is the gist.</p>
<h2 id="so-does-it-work">So... does it work?</h2>
<p>The preliminary work I have done seem promising. 
The video shows some very basic sequences I've made replicated the simple demo shown by the killer instinct devs.</p>
<p>TODO describe how things look and just what the reader is seeing.</p>
<p>It's been pretty exciting to construct all of this and I plan on see just how far I can push this.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
