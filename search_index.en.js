all included.\n\n\nCustom circuit elements creation extends not only to properties ranging from resistance, capacitance, inductance, and voltage but also uncertainty.\nCustom measurement tools, and instruments, can also be constructed.

This doesn't happen often, and neither do interesting tweets that I can dive into with statistical toys.\nBelow I will attempt to build a toy model for top 8 double elimination tournaments and determine the probability for a player coming from losers side to winning the tournament.  Additionally, we'll determine how probable it is for a set of 33 tournaments to occur without this.\nPromised myself I would make zero suggestions on format improvements. However, 33 events in a row is 33 events in a row. When do we need to start talking about this? Now? The next event? If it gets to 50 in a row? If we go the whole year again?— Glenn - thegametwok (@thegametwok) May 3, 2021  \n\nFor those who do not know fighting game tournaments are generally double elimination. Meaning you have to lose twice in tournament to be removed.\nThere are in fact two brackets in double elimination tournaments; one bracket for winners, those who haven't lost, and the other for those who have lost once.\nThis double bracket structure makes this an interesting problem, a simple sequential analysis won't cut it. \n\nGrand finals.\nWe'll be begin with something easy, grand finals.\nGrand finals for a double elimination tournament can contain either one or two matches between players. One if the player in winners bracket wins the first match. Two if they lose.  This sets up a very simple stats problem.  For the player in losers to win they must win two matches back to back. If the players are equally skilled we can treat each match as a coin flip, where each player as a 50% probability a given game. To win two games in a row we take 50% * 50%. Meaning that for equally skilled players one can expect the player coming from losers to win about 25% of the time.  This was pretty simple high school stats.  We can build a small toy model for this where we essentially flip two coins. The results are essentially the same a before with a bit of variance. \nThe process of coming back from losers to win is pretty deal. This analysis proves as much, however this isn't what we're interested in.  Let's now extent our analysis to top 8.\nTop 8\nTop 8 in a double elimination format has 4 players in winners and 4 players in losers. For the first round of play each pool plays against its self. The players on winners side pair off and the players in losers do the same. \nThe losers from winners side get pushed to the losers bracket, while the losers from loser side exit the tournament. \nThis happens one more time until the bracket has one player in winners side and two in losers. The two in losers face off, the winner of which plays against the player in winners side to determine the champion.\nThis situation is quite a bit more complicated than grand finals, but we can still produce an analytic estimate. Lets, again, assume that each player in our top 8 has equal probability to win against any other player. Looking from losers the brake down goes as follows(the percentage is probability that winner is coming from losers side):  losers 1:  100%, Losers Quarter: 75% (at least one must survive), Losers Semi: 50%, Grand finials: 50% * 50%.  This leaves us at about 9%. I should note that I didn't handle losers quarter and losers semi finals properly. The event where both players originally from losers win their loser quarter matches are not handled, this should bump up our estimate. Knowing this, I'd expect a player coming from losers to win about 12% of the time.\nUsing toy models, the model is given at the bottom of the page, we can run our very own top 8s.\nFor the initial toys I'll be assuming each player has an equal probability to win any given match.\nI should note that is not realistic. Better players tend not to lose, let alone lose before top 8. Additionally, most if not all tournaments seed making it unlikely for strong players to face each other early in the bracket. That being said I ran 1000 tournaments with this set up. Of the 1000 103 were won by players from the losers bracket.\nSince we're working with toys it's nice to see the associated distribution, below is such a plot made up of 100 of these 1000 toy runs.  From the plot one should expect a player to come from losers to win it all about 13% of the time. \n\nThe previous toy assumed all players had the same probability of winning, as stated before this is not reality.\nThe next example sets the winners side players to have a staggered win probability from 0.65 to 0.5 in increments of 0.05. This change is pretty impactful. The average win rate of someone coming from losers to win grand finals is now ~8%.\n\nConclusion\nWhile all this stats stuff is fun what do we make of Glenn's complaint? Is a run of 33 tournaments without a winner from loser's side highly unlikely or is it par for the course?\nUsing the results given above we can come to the following conclusions. If all players have the same chance of winning the probability that the winner comes from loser side is about 13%. Therefore the probability that the winner comes only from winner's side for 33 tournaments is (1.0-0.13)^33 = 0.01. About 1%. That would make this a fairly rare sequence of events. However, as we discussed earlier this is not reality.  Each player does not have the same probability to win.\nUsing our second case we find the following: (1. - 0.08)^33 = 0.064. About 6.4% more than 6 times our 1st example. 6.4% is about 1/15 or, roughly speaking, getting heads 4 times in a row. Not so rare, but would definitely raise an eye brow.\nFortunately, we don't have to end there. The folks over at one frame link responded to the original tweet thread to give some stats. About 6.71% of tournaments in their data base have a player coming from losers to win it all. Using the same technique as before we see about a 10% chance to have a streak of 33 tournaments with a winner not coming from losers side. This is not so rare at all.  In fact this is on par with getting 3 heads in a row.\nThis number is considerably less; of 3922 tournaments, 263 have started in top 8 losers and won the entire tournament.Or 6.71%. https://t.co/dnKsMRFktc— One Frame Link #BLM (@OneFrameLink) May 3, 2021  \nI don't know if this post will be helpful to Glenn or any tournament organizers, but it was a fun little write up for me.

This particular project attempted to replace the data storage and quick histogram generation/viewing features of ROOT. The data format and associated viewer were able to replace ROOT, at least for my use case.  I decided, however, not to use the format for my thesis work.  At that point too much of my tool chain and analysis pipeline required ROOT, and fully switching would have been more costly than it was worth. However, if I were to do another data analysis I would seriously contemplate constructing a custom format. You can find the final product ere, https://github.com/TKGgunter/PhysicsDataSuite.\n\n\nRoot is THE underlying technology that backs many modern particle physics experiments.\nSelf described as a modular scientific software framework, I take issue with this description, it \ndeals with everything from data visualization to statistical analysis and data storage.\nPhD students in particle physics one are expected to use this toolset in some capacity.\nMost modern High Energy Physics (HEP) analyses rely heavily on ROOT.\nI however, don't use ROOT in my data analysis workflow.\nI opt for python, using a combination of matplotlib, scipy, numpy and sklearn for my visualisation and analysis needs.\nI still rely on ROOT dependency when transforming data from the '.root' format into something a bit more palatable.\nI am not alone in this shift. \nMany physicist are moving away from ROOT.\nPersonally the fragility and friction that occurs when exploring datasets are ROOT's main drawbacks.\nIt should be noted that ROOT is under active development and the team has addressed many if its stability issues.\nSo, why not remove ROOT entirely? Why continue to have this dependency when I only use it to read and store data.\nWell, I have no good answer other than it's there. This blog post, and perhaps others will detail the design and implementation of a dataformat I created to replaced ROOT.\nI hope this blog can be educational and demystify one of the basic technologies we use on a daily bases.\nSection I:  What makes a file format?\nConstructing a custom file format isn't all that difficult.\nIt requires some general understanding of how computers work, your data and how you use that data.\nTo begin lets discuss data, what's being stored.\nI work in the high energy domain of particle physics.\nIn this domain we are usually interested in distributions of floating point and integer numbers.\nScientist in my field often organize data in units of events.\nIn this case an event is the measurements made after two protons collide with each other.\nAn easy way to think of this is through the comma separated value model, your typical csv file.\nIn this model a row is an event and the columns can be thought of as the measurements made during an event (called features from here on).\nThe number of features aren't necessarily known a priori and the list often grows during the course of a project.\nThe same is true for the number of events.\n\n\t \n\t\tfeature1 \n\t\tfeature2 \n\t\t... \n\t\tfeatureN \n\t \n\t \n\t\t 123.4 \n\t\t 1  \n\t\t...   \n\t\t \"type1\" \n\t \n\t \n\t\t 13.4 \n\t\t 12 \n\t\t... \n\t\t \"type3\" \n\t \n\nFor my analysis I require:\n32 bit floating point (high precision isn't important so maybe this can be 16bit),\n32 bit integers (I could probably get away with 8 bits but lets keep things symmetric),\nshort strings (something less than a tweet, 280 characters).\nIn addition we must account for a high volume of data.\nAnalysis in high energy physics can easily include millions of events. \nFor this format to be useful it must have a memory foot print comparable to ROOT's.\nNow that we have an idea of the problem lets talk more about file formats.\nA file format is a kind of design document that defines the meaning of the bits within a file.\nThe best way to learn about building \"document\" is by studying the spec. of an some other format like BMP or WAV.\nI will not doing an in depth review of these formats, but there is a terrific synopsis at link.\nTo begin file formats are not magic.  They are a specification that assigns meaning to a collection of bits and bytes.\nOne can in fact look directly at a binary file, with a standard editor like vim, and often deduce the format through visual inspection.\nIf we open a ROOT file you'll notice that the first four characters(bytes) decode to \"root\".  Most files are like this.\nIf you open an executable the first three characters are probably \"ELF\" and a bitmap is \"BM\".\nThese notations give the operating system and programs a way to determine how the file should be decoded, what format they should assume the file is in.\nContinuing through the file we notice a ton of random characters, though occasionally there will be some human readable text.\nIf you haven't done this already I would suggest going through a few binary files on your own time to get an intuition of how these files are constructed.\nNow that we are on the same page, lets begin laying out a general header specification. \nAs stated previously the beginning bytes are reserved for indicating the file format.\nLike BMP and WAV files we'll begin the file with a format tag.\nNext I want communicate how our data is stored, the number of features stored, feature names, total number of events stored, etc.\nI'm thinking something like this:\n \n\t\n\t\t Signature \n\t\t 24 bit \n\t\t \"T\", \"D\", \"F\" \n\t\n\t\n\t\t Compression flag \n\t\t 8 bit \n\t\t integer \n\t\n\t\n\t\t Offset \n\t\t 32 bit \n\t\t integer \n\t\n\t\n\t\t number of features \n\t\t 32 bit \n\t\t integer \n\t\n\t\n\t\t number of events \n\t\t 32 bit \n\t\t integer \n\t\n\t\n\t\t feature names \n\t\t ?? bit \n\t\t string \n\t\n\t\n\t\t feature type and size\n\t\t 8 bit and 32 bit\n\t\t integer and integer \n\t\n \nSignature is our file format tag. I've chosen the characters \"T\", \"D\", \"F\", for Thoth's data format. \nYup super original. When we eventually read these files we'll first check the first three bytes of the file to determine if we are reading the correct file format.\nAt this point I should note that there are often formats that share the same signature, TDF for example. \nThe last thing to note is the 24 bit allocated to this specification. Of course this is the because ASCII characters require 8 bits.\nCompression flag is as the name suggest. The value held here describes how that data is compressed.\nOffset describes when the header ends and when the contiguous data block begin.\nNumber of features and number of events are as the names suggest. It should be noted that by having these be 32 bit integers the maximum number of features and events is 2 billion, which we probably will not hit in features, but may very well hit in number of events.  For now I'm going to say that hitting this limit is very unlikely. \nYou may have noticed feature names have no bit size and is not a standard Clang data type. \nIn fact Strings can vary greatly depending on the language you develop in.\nIn C strings are an array of bytes that are terminated by a trailing zero.\nWithout this zero most C programs will assume that the string goes on forever.\nThe trailing zero, method for structuring a string, is one of the most compact ways to store a string but its also the most error prone.\nAlternatively on could store string as the length of the string, number of characters in the string, followed an array of the characters.\nThis is far less error prone but can be a fair bit larger, especially for short strings.\nI'm going to choose the less error prone route for this this task.\nThis means feature names will be a 32bit int then a character array. \nI will be storing characters as 8 bit integers like out file signature.\nWe also need to store type information.\nThis is pretty easy we have only 3 types we are interested in storing, ints, floats and strings.\nThere is a bit more information I'd like the store here.\nThe total number of bytes used to store the data for that feature over all events.\nThis additional information has a bit todo with the overall structure of our file which I'll explain now. \nSection II. Data\nROOT stores data in a event model. \nYou can think about it as rows of a csv.\nFor example lets say you have the following dataset.\nFeature1Feature2Feature3\n1.01231\"alpha\"\n34.311\"alpha\"\n12.3231\"beta\"\n\nIn root data would be stored 1.0, 1231, \"alpha\", 34.3, 11, \"alpha\"...\nThis type of structure is extremely helpful, and natural when dealing with detectors, or time ordered data.\nHowever most HEP analyses are not like. \nHEP analyses are more interested in distributions or the shape of the data, for a given feature over many events.\nContiguous chunks of data, as in storing columns contiguously, is much more useful.\nThis is because computers can load data from these contiguous chunks far quicker than it can mixed data.\nIf you've ever worked in pyroot and gone between ROOT files and HDF files you'll experience this directly. \nLoading ROOT files are at least 5-10x slower than HDF files. HDF files much like our format is column based.\nWrite this data is simply writing the arrays to disk in the order we've listed the features in the header.\nThat's all for now.\nNext time I'll cover implementation of a simple data viewer for linux. Thank you for your time.\n\nIf you have any corrections please contact me through github and let me know. \nI am not a ROOT engineer so I may have gotten some of the details wrong.\n\n","id":"https://tkggunter.github.io/uproot/uprootingi/","title":"Uprooting ROOT Part I"},"https://tkggunter.github.io/uproot/uprootingii/":{"body":"\n\nThis post highlights work done during my graduate studies.

However, if I were to do another data analysis I would seriously contemplate constructing a custom format. You can find the final product ere, https://github.com/TKGgunter/PhysicsDataSuite.\n\n\nLast time, link, we discussed and built a simple data format to hold high energy physics(HEP) data. \nToday we will be discussing X11 and how we can use it to create a simple data viewer. \nThis post is intended to be an introduction X11, a way to help folks get started using a tool that has a rather negative reputation.\nIt is not intended to be a step by step guide to building the data viewer, nor is it a comprehensive guide to X11.\nDisclaimer: I am not a X11 expert. There will be more efficient ways of doing things, this is only meant to help readers get started\nX11 was chosen because it is the most used window management system on Linux. And Linux is THE operating system for CERN and much of the HEP community.\nGoals:\nI've used the term data viewer, quite a bit over course of this blog series, but have failed to define what I mean.\nFor my needs a data viewer gives a user the ability to view histograms of saved features, and occasionally plot multiple histograms on top of each other.\nThis functionality requires a few features from X11. They are as follows:\n\nwindow creation\ndraw rectangle\ndraw characters\nmouse interaction.\n\nWe'll be cover the basics of window creation, drawing and event gathering.\nFor anyone who wants to skip a head you can learn a lot from Brian Hammond's example code. \nI will not be copying Hammond's example, but there will be enough over lap such that if you feel comfortable with the code above you need not bother with this blog.\nX11 basics:\nTo begin we need to initialize a window.\nTo do this we first request access to the window management system. The X server is x11's window management system.\nNote, every operating system has some window management system; learning any management system is good preparation for learning others.\nX server is an unique service as it allows for local and remote window management. \nWhen working remotely x server will connect via TCP or DECnet communication channels.\nThese connections can be rather low in bandwidth, unlike desktop broad casting, and is often an acceptable means conduct analyses.\nThe X11/Xlib.h contains most X11 functions and macros we are interested in. \nXOpenDisplay is used to gain access to the X server.\nWe'll be using the return value of this function quite a bit, so it's best to place it in some general scope.\nYou can find the documentation to XOpenDisplay and any function/constant we might use here.\nThe next want a window.\nXCreateSimpleWindow can be used to create one.\nXCreateSimpleWindow inherits properties from the specified root window. If you'd like to set these properties yourself you can use XCreateWindow.\nTo get the default root window call DefaultRootWindow.\nNow that we have asked the X server to generate a window, we must now ask that window to be mapped to the display and give it an Atom.\nWe can map the window using 'XMapWindow'.\nAttaching the Atom is done using 'XSetWMProtocols'.\nOur current main function is as follows:\n#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;\n\nint main(int n_args, char** args){\n    Display *dis;\n    int screen;\n    Window win;\n    GC gc;\n    static Atom wm_delete_window;\n    int window_width  = 1000;\n    int window_height = 600 ;\n\n    {//Initialization\n        dis=XOpenDisplay((char *)0);\n\n        win=XCreateSimpleWindow(dis, DefaultRootWindow(dis), 0, 0, window_width, window_height, 0, 0, 0);\n\n        XMapWindow(dis, win);\n\n        wm_delete_window = XInternAtom(dis, \"WM_DELETE_WINDOW\", False);\n        XSetWMProtocols(dis, win, &amp;wm_delete_window, 1);\n    }\n\n    while (true) {\n    }\n}\n\n\nTo compile and run you'll need to run something like the following in terminal, g++ PROGRAM_NAME.c -o PROGRAM_NAME -lX11 -std=c++11 &amp;&amp; ./PROGRAM_NAME.\nRunning this code should result in an empty black window.\nNow that we have a window we should attempt to draw something.\nx11 contains a plethora of basic drawing tools. \nLets begin with drawing a rectangle.\nXDrawRectangle is the x11 function used to create a rectangle.\nif you check the arguments you'll notice one argument we have yet to satisfy, GC. \nGC stands for graphical context.\nGraphical context are required for all draw calls.\nA graphics context can be obtained through the use of XCreateGC.\nWith a GC we can now draw a rectangle.\nDrawing strings can be done in a similar manner. XDrawString, is the x11 function used to draw text.\nIf you are coming from a non C background remember this is a C api. Strings must be passed via a character pointer.\nThe length of the string is passed separately. \nIf you've been following along you will have noticed that none of your commands are drawn.\nThis is because your commands have not been exposed.\nTo allow for periodic expose events, I believe these occur when ever the x server feels, we need to include a selection mask.\nXSelectInput is the function we are interested in. The ExposureMask is required to updated the window.\nLets take another  look at the code now.\n#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;\n\n\n\nint main(int n_args, char** args){\n    Display *dis;\n    int screen;\n    Window win;\n    GC gc;\n    static Atom wm_delete_window;\n    int window_width  = 1000;\n    int window_height = 600 ;\n\n    {//Initialization\n        dis=XOpenDisplay((char *)0);\n\n        win=XCreateSimpleWindow(dis, DefaultRootWindow(dis), 0, 0, window_width, window_height, 0, 0, 0);\n        XSelectInput(dis, win, ExposureMask);\n\n        XMapWindow(dis, win);\n\n        wm_delete_window = XInternAtom(dis, \"WM_DELETE_WINDOW\", False);\n        XSetWMProtocols(dis, win, &amp;wm_delete_window, 1);\n\n        gc = XCreateGC(dis, win, 0, 0);\n    }\n\n\n    XEvent event;\n    while (true) {\n        XNextEvent(dis, &amp;event);\n        {\n            int x = 50;\n            int y = 50;\n            int w = 50;\n            int h = 50;\n\n            XSetForeground(dis, gc, 0xffffffff);\n            XDrawRectangle(dis, win, gc, x, window_height - y - h, w, h);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nExecuting the code above an outline of a rectangle should be displayed at the bottom of the screen.\nNow that you've drawn a few things you might notice that the axis used by x11 is left handed.\nMeaning that origin, (0, 0), is found in the top left corner of the window instead of the bottom left.\nIf you find this hard to use you can of course create a wrapper function.\nThe final step requires get events.  Events are interactions with mouse, keyboard, or other peripherals they can also be generated from code by things like Exposure events.\nTo extend the number of events we interact with we need include additional event types in our input mask. Current we are only accepting exposure events. \nTo increase we need to bitwise or ExposureMask with a few other masks we are interested in. \nFor this project I want to set things up for mouse events. ButtonPressMask is needed for this. (If you want to do things with keyboard events KeyPressMask is needed.)\nYour XSelectInput call should look something like the following, XSelectInput(dis, win, ExposureMask|ButtonPressMask);.\nWith that we can gather mouse events.

This particular project attempted to replace the data storage and quick histogram generation/viewing features of ROOT. The data format and associated viewer were able to replace ROOT, at least for my use case.  I decided, however, not to use the format for my thesis work.  At that point too much of my tool chain and analysis pipeline required ROOT, and fully switching would have been more costly than it was worth. However, if I were to do another data analysis I would seriously contemplate constructing a custom format. You can find the final product ere, https://github.com/TKGgunter/PhysicsDataSuite.\n\n\nThrough the course of this blog series I've discussed data formats and x11.\nThis blog post will show off the program/library I made using that information.\nThe code can be found here.\nInterfacing with the file format\nAs stated in the initial blog the file format was originally made to replace ROOT.\nAs such one would need to interface with it like one might ROOT. \nHEP scientist often work on a event by event model.\nI wanted to keep this interface as simple as possible. \nBelow is an example for initializing our data file.\n    SerialDataFormat sdf;\n    std::map&lt;std::string, float&gt;        float_map;\n    std::map&lt;std::string, int&gt;          int_map;\n    std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;  string_map;\n\n    sdf.vars_float  = &amp;float_map;\n    sdf.vars_int    = &amp;int_map;\n    sdf.vars_str    = &amp;string_map;\n\n    float_map[\"grade\"]  = 0.0;\n    float_map[\"height(cm)\"]  = 0.0;\n    int_map[\"age\"]      = 0;\n    string_map[\"name\"]  = \"\";\n\n    stage_variables( &amp;sdf );\n\n\nstage_variables primes the system to know which inputs to look out for.\nWhen updating the events one might program the following;\n    while (true){\n        float_map[\"grade\"] = 10.0;\n        float_map[\"height(cm)\"] = 0.5;\n        int_map[\"age\"]     = 20;\n\n        update_buffers( &amp;sdf );\n        ///....\n    }\n\n\nupdate_buffers pushes the new values to buffers held by sdf.\nIt's a pretty easy set up can can be extended with some additional functions or macros.\nThere are some issues with this setup. One being the lack of compile time or runtime checking for spelling mistakes that can occur during when updating the maps. \nRuntime errors can be added with the use of macros or functions, but compile time errors would be preferable.\nIf reflection were available in C/C++ compile time errors could more easily be a thing.\nData viewer\nThe data view is an extremely stripped down version of what ROOT does. \nThis is because ROOT does too much.\nOften this additional functionality ROOT provides gets in the what of common task.\nThe viewer list all features in file, and plots histograms of the distributions, allows for some simple overly functionality, logy plotting.\nA video of the viewer is below.\n\n\nIf I were to use this regularly I'd add a few additional features. \n3 and 2 sigma cut offs, toggle able colors would among them. \nConclusion\nI had a blast making this a few years back, and it's been fun reviewing the code and writing the blog post. \nI hope you enjoyed reading it.

One aimed at deriving game state, the other the brain of the ai. \nGame state, for fighting games, is information describing everything from distance between two characters, to how often a player jumps. \nWhen working within a code base these quantities are much more easily and quickly determined.\nMany hobbyist fighting game ai developers determine game state by grabs values from game memory. \nThis project will not. Instead, game state information will be determined using visuals and audio.\nThis choice offers significant advantages and disadvantages.\nAudio and visual information allows for a general method to derive game state. \nFighting games use a common visual and auditory language. These common design elements common allow players/spectators to quickly parse unfamiliar games. \nThese elements can also be used to construct algorithms.\nDeriving game state using this technique is difficult, and can often produce results inconsistent with reality.\nI'll discuss the specifics for parsing audio and visual information later, but the basics, as stated before, are leveraged from common fighting game design language.\nFor example:\n\nheath bars at the top of screen.\ncolor palettes of playable characters being distinct between opposing characters and the background.\nconsistent prematch starting positions \nand other.\n\nThrough the use of these elements in addition to incorporating naive machine learning one can determine some of the basics features a game state.\nOutside of game state the brain of the ai needs to be created.\nHere I leverage the work described by Iron Galaxy.\nXcopyfgc uses recorded user inputs and game state data to determine what the ai should do next.\nI like to think of the system as a train on a set of train tracks. \nDuring a match the ai replays the inputs recorded by the player all the while checking the game state. \nThis is the train moving along on the track.\nIf the current game state becomes too dissimilar to the recorded game state the ai will look to a different recording that better matches the current state.\nIf it finds one it switches the track.\nI'll be writing an in depth post on this some time later as well, but this is the gist.\nSo... does it work?\nThe preliminary work I have done seem promising. \nThe video shows some very basic sequences I've made replicated the simple demo shown by the killer instinct devs.\nTODO describe how things look and just what the reader is seeing.\nIt's been pretty exciting to construct all of this and I plan on see just how far I can push this.\nThanks for reading.\n","id":"https://tkggunter.github.io/xcopyfgc/xcopyfgc-intro/","title":"Xcopyfgc: an attempt at a general Shadow Ai system."}},"docInfo":{"https://tkggunter.github.io/":{"body":2,"title":3},"https://tkggunter.github.io/circuitsim/":{"body":2,"title":3},"https://tkggunter.github.io/circuitsim/circuitsim/":{"body":127,"title":2},"https://tkggunter.github.io/first/":{"body":9,"title":3},"https://tkggunter.github.io/presentations/":{"body":50,"title":1},"https://tkggunter.github.io/projects/":{"body":2,"title":2},"https://tkggunter.github.io/projects/circuit-sim/":{"body":7,"title":5},"https://tkggunter.github.io/projects/uproot/":{"body":7,"title":4},"https://tkggunter.github.io/stats-and-tournaments/":{"body":806,"title":3},"https://tkggunter.github.io/uproot/":{"body":2,"title":3},"https://tkggunter.github.io/uproot/uprootingi/":{"body":896,"title":3},"https://tkggunter.github.io/uproot/uprootingii/":{"body":877,"title":4},"https://tkggunter.github.io/uproot/uprootingiii/":{"body":273,"title":4},"https://tkggunter.github.io/xcopyfgc/":{"body":2,"title":3},"https://tkggunter.github.io/xcopyfgc/xcopyfgc-intro/":{"body":397,"title":6}},"length":15},"lang":"English"};
