Imagine a construction site, which you are told will be a mixed residential/commercial high rise.
One morning you walk by the site, which is in the beginning of construction. There are bare metal beams,
scaffolding, cranes, the general construction site accompaniment.
Imagine now someone near by asks you to critique the final building based on the site as it is today. Would you live in this building?
Will this build meet you personal aesthetic requirements?  Could you recommend the building to others?
These are ridiculous questions, the answers to which on average, I suspect, would trend negatively because constructions sites are 
hideous, noisy, dusty, obstructions that in no way represent the final product. 
These very same questions however are asked during the pitching of software as it is under development.

During the pitching process for a set of physics lab simulations for Northwestern University
it struck me how little intuition the average person has about the development of software projects.
And I do mean intuition here. Everyone knows creating software is hard and requires skill, 
but when critiquing a software project that is in the beginnings of development these understandings disappear.
Expectations of this project development has been
muddy and negative. The reason is two fold. 
The first is a mis-interpretation of completeness and an inability to visualize the final project. 
Software projects are often interactable and visually coherent from beginning
to end, leading users to perceive them as complete or near completion.
Games are often a set of rectangles, lines, and crude visual assets before entering the final stages of development, 
but these crude beginnings often lead to projects being discarded by publishers. Braid is a good example of a
game that was initial rejected by Xbox, but would later be one of the most successful indie games.
The second is an incorrect expectation the development process, its ebb and flow. 


The analogy developed earlier is not truely accurate to the situation I am describing here.
The main difference is that construction has already been pitched and that pitch was accepted.
This of coarse must be done for construction as construction is extremely costly, but both monetarily
and in physical impact. Software does not share one of these cost. The reduced cost makes it 
attractive for software developers and employers to request a pitch while development is in progress.
As a result software developers often carry the majority of the financial burden. This is how I have carried
out the project I am working on so far, but I suspect there this a better day.



<b>The Construction Project Process</b>
https://www.letsbuild.com/blog/6-stages-of-a-project-in-construction#:~:text=There%20are%20normally%20four%20different,project%20has%20to%20be%20outlined.
  - client decide on a project
  - client hires designers
  - land deeds, city vouchers and given, many other folks are hired
  - rent/purchase equipment and materials, hire constructions workers
  - construct the damn thing
  - post construction


UGH
+ Through cost estimates, architecture plans, renderings are used to communicate the final 
+ past work and historical examples

Realstate firms know this so they produce beautiful renderings of how building and surrouding neighborhood
will look after completion.
